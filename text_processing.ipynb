         "Nose: a lot of sherry influence, but never in-your-face. First tart gooseberries, yellow apples and oranges, along with bread dough and plain malt. A little damp chalk too. Then it becomes more buttery, with a hint of blonde tobacco. Some vegetal notes, lightly roasted coffee beans, a certain mustiness and leather. Mouth: still a bit of a mashup. The vegetal side is bigger, along with green fruits and persistent chalky notes. Apple peelings, pepper and nutmeg, as well as some roasted nuts. Quite robust, with some sweetness underneath, but the spiciness overtakes it quickly. Bittersweet woody notes towards the end, disrupting the balance further. Finish: quite long, with punchy oak spice, more bittersweet hints, nutmeg and chalk. Most of these secret Highlands are rumoured to come from Clynelish. Most of them seem to be outliers that don’t really fit the official profile. Here as well, there are some pleasant elements but it also misses some typical markers so the overall enjoyment is, well, merely okay. Still available from the Whiskydudes website.    ",

Then becoming more classic, on plums and raisins, leathery notes, orange peels and light hints of walnuts. Just a little toffee. All good. Mouth: slightly tart now, more oranges (fresh and candied), along with brown sugar and a little burnt toast. Mid-palate a nice fruity layer appears, think tangerine and roasted pineapple. Then some caramelized nuts and cinnamon. Finish: quite long, getting a tad winey now, with hints of dark cocoa, more raisins and a coastal touch of salinity. Ah yes, much more classic. Inchgower may not be a big name, but it’s a very flexible spirit. The Oloroso influence is well balanced too: success.",

Hints of black pepper and dried figs in the background, along with roasted nuts, walnuts and salted caramel. Finish: not too long, slightly leathery, with drying herbal notes but still some raisiny echoes as well. Now we’re talking, this session is evolving in crescendo. This is simply very balanced and true to its origins. I feel the sherry cask was nicely complementary too. Still available from a few partner retailers.",

Marinated charred meat, caramelized notes and tart plum. A really nice mix of sweet, sour and savoury. Spanish ham, a drop of espresso and toffee.

Some sweet elements, like raisins, but certainly not the PX influence we were expecting. Still a sourish winey note, and the smoky layer has a faint musty / sulphuric edge. Finish: fairly long. A bit thinner, nuttier and spicier. Earthy notes and raisins too. So, does this scream ‘high-quality cask’? Not really. Somehow the PX cask has more drying elements than the (technically dry) Palo Cortado. It all shows a lot of different containers are currently presented as sherry(-ish) casks.

Then dark honey and caramel notes, along with some vanilla pastry and hints of baking spice, especially nutmeg. Mouth: the toasted wood is getting firmer now, with the bitterness of coffee and herbal extracts. Drying tobacco leaves, more nutmeg and ginger, as well as light resinous notes. Sandalwood. Some dried fruits underneath, along with burnt caramel. Finish: quite long, still dark and rather wood-driven. Cigar boxes, heavily infused herbal tea and caramelized notes. This is 100% Folle Blanche. Quite a robust start, with a fair deal of wood coming through. Not necessarily my preferred style of armagnac, but the ABV helps to keep the balance.    ",

There’s also a funky hint of tepache and green grape skins, along with a subtle ashy hint. After settling down, it delivers flashes of yellow fruits and dried wildflowers. Totally unexpected. Mouth: more accessible, even though it’s still a rather sharp mix of grape juice with bags of salt, pine resin and peppermint. Still some vaguely farmy elements, along with grappa and grape seeds, sunflower oil and hints of grapefruit skins. Finish: medium, with hints of (unflavoured) tsipouro and mildly bitter herbs. This is 100% Baco. Independent bottlers usually don’t venture into this category of young spirits, so this is definitely a bold choice. A very peculiar profile. I had to try this on different occasions (as always with samples that don’t “click” right away) and I have to admit it grows on you.",

Then plenty of polished furniture, beeswax and nice hints of tobacco underneath. A few drops of old Oloroso. It also shows a rancio note and a clarity that brings it closer to cognac. Mouth: starts well, with this fruity core again. Figs and dates, with brighter berries and hints of bergamot and orange peels. A subtle floral note (rose petals) too. Mid-palate it turns towards herbal tea with a little ginger. There’s some tannins as well, along with clove oil and a woody edge. Finish: long, a combination of dried fruits, walnuts and some leathery hints. A lovely armagnac from the start to the finish. There’s a bit of tangy oak coming through, but perfectly in line with expectations for such an old armagnac. Pretty excellent and a great first selection.",

This moves towards resinous hints and some clove oil, which makes it a little thin and lightweight, lacking some of the darker notes.

A nice juicy acidity, paired to gingery notes and a punch of pepper. Now more towards blackberries and black cherries again. Some marmalade and cocoa in the end.

Mouth: candied fruits and stone fruits, with hints of pear and pineapple in the background. Then the metallic side comes back, along with ginger and pepper, up to the point where it becomes ever so slightly medicinal. Candied lemon peels, some toasted wood and hints of leathery dryness in the end. Finish: medium length, with dried fruits, drying liquorice roots and some honeyed notes. This is more of a yellow fruit style, with more youth, less complexity and a peculiar mineral / metallic note that is a little out of place.

Then pine needles and mentholated notes, as well as some nutmeg and allspice. Hints of baked apple and fig jam in the background, but they are struggling to get heard under the tannins and cigar boxes. The wood also brings a fragrant element. Finish: long, quite mentholated, with a profound earthy note but mostly a numbing combination of wood and alcohol. This was 100% Colombard, matured in a Gascony ‘black oak’ barrel. Quite the opposite of the 2001, richer and far more wood-driven. Even a little over-oaked, with the appearance of floral potpourri. Fairly cheap but a little over the top, in my opinion.",

Finish: medium to long, with a bit of alcohol heat along with orchard fruits, marmalade and hints of liquorice.

Quite woody, but in an aromatic way. There are some bright fruity hints to keep things in check. Some honey and citrus acidity as well.

         "Nose: very classy sherry. That means raisins, dried apricots, juicy sultanas and cherries. Oak polish. Then also honeyed notes, hints of pollen and toffee, light tobacco and brown sugar. Drops of high quality Oloroso as well. Hints of milk chocolate coated nuts and caramelized peanuts, along with subtle oak spice like cinnamon and ginger. This could have been a Family Cask release so far. Mouth: the alcohol comes out more, leaving a bit of a sherry brandy feeling. Still raisins and cherries, with boozy fruit cake and orange peels. Mild herbal notes and toasted walnuts, along with leathery notes. Then increasing cocoa, plum jam and a faint hint of sourish coffee. Finish: long and balanced. More sweet and sour fruits, nutty hints and chocolate. A rather excellent Glenfarclas, much like in the days of the first Family Casks. All about elegance, with a good dose of fruits, polished oak and refined herbs. Great selection work!    ",

Being a modern seasoned cask, there’s a good dose of active wood and vanilla too. Then darker hints of coffee beans, toffee and dark chocolate in the background. Just a balsamic / varnished touch as well. Mouth: very punchy. Again this mix of raisins, red berries, prunes, orange peels, dark chocolate and a leathery dryness. A lot of honey. Some herbal extracts as well, before it moves towards resinous notes, cinnamon, black pepper and candied ginger. Spices become quite loud towards the end, but the dram does take water well. Finish: long and spicy, with aniseed, cinnamon and a boozy (sherry brandy) edge. As good as it gets when it comes to modern sherry casks. A fairly big fruitiness, with a big bourbonny footprint as well. It’s actually a bourbon cask that was transferred to first-fill sherry after 8 years of maturation. A very solid example of Billy Walker’s style.",

Mouth: sooty and herbal peat, in a rather chisseled way, with a certain lemony and aniseedy sharpness. Then black peppercorns, caramelized nuts, herbal honey and hints of oranges. Marmalade too, but never the deep sweetness we were expecting. Finish: quite long, mostly on black pepper now, along with salted ashes.

Behind this I find generous tangerines, pineapples and some preserved peaches, along with hints of orange blossom and herbal honey. Then whiffs of jasmine and old potpourri. There’s a darker hint of tea and oriental spice in the distance, but otherwise this is a fairly high-pitched profile. Such aromatic elegance after all these years! Mouth: a fruit explosion. Very juicy citrus notes, like lime and pink grapefruit, along with mango and drops of passion fruit syrup. Then orange peels and hints of Earl Grey , as well as growing spearmint and a light mentholated note. Hints of liquorice, some herbal tea and a subtle leafy note (tobacco) in the background, adding more depth. Towards the end a little leather and beautiful rancio too. Finish: long, with more orange peels now, generous minty notes and herbs, as well as some fruit jellies and a hint of cedar. Beautifully vibrant on the nose, which stays light and seductive. A bit more depth on the palate, with a nice power after all these years, but still plenty of fruits as well. No signs of tiredness at all. Truly excellent cognac which checks all the boxes for me.

Mouth: the texture is quite nice, with some syrupy notes despite its modest strength. Light honey and brown sugar, sweetened herbal tea, with vague ripe fruits. Increasingly grainy and herbal towards the end, showing liquorice and a subtle bitter edge too. Finish: fairly short and malty, on nutmeg, salted caramel and a little cumin. Yeah well, not much of a discovery. It’s pretty flat and uninspired so there’s mostly a sentimental value.

Then also slightly tropical notes, like roasted pineapple and banana, in the background. Obviously also the typical markers of old metal tools, candle wax, herbal tea and burnt firwood. Mouth: more tobacco and herbs, as well as asubtle walnut bitterness. Then back to blackberries, sour cherries and raisins, some oriental spice and a hint of motor oil. Some black peppercorns and sandalwood, with glazed chestnuts and hints of liquorice. Some cocoa as well, although the whole gets thinner towards the end. Finish: long, with a lightly tannic edge (wine cask after all), peppery oak, earthy smoke and hints of salted caramel. This cracker reminded me of these sherry bottlings from Decadent Drinks. Great whisky, expressing its coastal provenance but also showing a nice fruitiness. Recommended, even for people who don’t generally like Port influence. Available from Milroy’s of Soho.

Pineapple comes later. Then it moves towards citrus zest, paraffin and hints of nutmeg and green tea. A subtle saltiness in the background. Hints of dried flowers too. Finish: reasonably long given the low ABV. Back to chamomile and vegetal oils, along with some lime and leafy notes. A fairly light and delicate whisky, but offering a lot of nice aromas and flavours. Fairly unmodern. A number of 1992s have hit the market in the past year or so, and they have all been pretty great.

Mouth: still plenty of umami character. Charred meat, rather a lot of oaky punch and simply alcohol too. Then heavy treacle, bitter chocolate, cinnamon and nutmeg. Tobacco leaves aplenty. Finish: long, with the same dark, leathery and savoury character. Not my style: a meaty spirit, an overdose of sherry, an insane ABV and a lack of fruits.

Then sweet caramel again, with a hint of latte, drying nuts and mild herbal tea. Nutmeg too. Finish: long, still showing this drying leafy note, wood spice, liquorice and more tobacco.

Not that this rum needs it. After comparing to the Oloroso, this appears to be sharper and cleaner, with a very light yeasty touch indeed. Overall fairly close to a naked Hampden. Mouth: boom. Very good, but heavy stuff. More brine, hints of vinegar and all kinds of synthetic materials. Then also a sour fruity note, a mix of lime juice and very unripe pineapple. Also a salty touch and some drying nutty notes towards the end (almonds). Finish: long and salty, on liquorice, peppermint, lemons and more esters. Nice rum, very pure. An extreme style, not very wide, and I sometimes find it hard work to drink this style.

The most balanced nose of all four in my opinion. Mouth: again truckloads of brine, acetone, glue and peppermint. I also detected a certain walnut dryness and over-infused tea. You really get that leathery / estery coating. Then one raisins perhaps, that must be the Oloroso. It seems this cask induced a bit more oak as well.

French oak perhaps, it displays a different kind of spiciness. Finish: very salty. Anchovies and acetone, with drops of red wine. This is the first one that doesn’t feel at ease with the cask.

Light tobacco and red berry notes. Then the usual ammonia, tarry notes and salty liquorice. In the end we’re getting that leathery dryness again, perhaps less sweet than expected after all. Finish: long but losing some of its richness now. In a series that focuses on cask types, I believe the cask should play first fiddle. This is the only version for which this is actually true, the others are still an ode to esters instead of wood.

         "Nose: totally immersive. Plenty of green olives, plastics, green banana peelings. Rosemary and peppermint, along with acetone and a lot of varnish. I’m not sure there’s any Fino influence. Not that this rum needs it. After comparing to the Oloroso, this appears to be sharper and cleaner, with a very light yeasty touch indeed. Overall fairly close to a naked Hampden. Mouth: boom. Very good, but heavy stuff. More brine, hints of vinegar and all kinds of synthetic materials. Then also a sour fruity note, a mix of lime juice and very unripe pineapple. Also a salty touch and some drying nutty notes towards the end (almonds). Finish: long and salty, on liquorice, peppermint, lemons and more esters. Nice rum, very pure. An extreme style, not very wide, and I sometimes find it hard work to drink this style. More importantly, I believe the point of this series is to showcase the difference of cask types, and in that sense I would have let it mature a little longer. A success nonetheless.    ",

         "Nose: much of the same varnishes, brines, olives, industrial glues and plenty of nail polish remover. There’s a bit of rounded sweetness here, but it seems like an overripe banana sweetness rather than actual sherry. Then also whiffs of raisins and currants. The most balanced nose of all four in my opinion. Mouth: again truckloads of brine, acetone, glue and peppermint. I also detected a certain walnut dryness and over-infused tea. You really get that leathery / estery coating. Then one raisins perhaps, that must be the Oloroso. It seems this cask induced a bit more oak as well. Finish: long and totally briney, with just a hint of berry juice and more nutty dryness. The spirit itself is still having the upper hand, even though the difference with the Fino cask is easy to notice. More complexity as well.",

Then much more rubbery notes than in the others, along with a subtle floral touch. All this behind the wall of glue, brine, mint and acetone, of course. The least impressive nose of all four. Mouth: reminiscent of a musty Port influence now, but also red wine again. Quite dry, with red fruits as well as a leathery, slightly tannic edge. French oak perhaps, it displays a different kind of spiciness. Finish: very salty. Anchovies and acetone, with drops of red wine. This is the first one that doesn’t feel at ease with the cask. In their Hampden DOK series I also felt the Madeira cask was well below the others. Not all Madeira casks are created equal.",

         "Nose: we’re not mentioning the esters any more, is that okay? Now the raisins and (fresh) figs are clear, maybe a little cassis, but even then the funky Jamaican side is much bigger. More spicy notes here (cardamom, pepper), even a very light hint of cocoa in the distance. Good. Mouth: richer and sweeter than the others. Caramelized walnuts, a bit of roasted sugar and tobacco. Light tobacco and red berry notes. Then the usual ammonia, tarry notes and salty liquorice. In the end we’re getting that leathery dryness again, perhaps less sweet than expected after all. Finish: long but losing some of its richness now. In a series that focuses on cask types, I believe the cask should play first fiddle. This is the only version for which this is actually true, the others are still an ode to esters instead of wood. The Oloroso wins on overall balance (by a small margin) but this is really nice as well.",

Mouth: active wood comes out now, with firm hints of cigar boxes and leather, along with raisins, figs and dates. Then back to orange peels, as well as some minty notes and sour berries. Mid-palate bitterness comes forward (herbal liqueur). There’s some Campbeltown funk as well, including a touch of flints and gunpowder. Finish: long, becoming leafier, on tobacco and salted caramel. Rumoured to be a teaspooned Glen Scotia. Quite characterful and not as dirty as I feared. Only the woody side is borderline for me.    ",

Then there’s also a mild hint of potpourri and marihuana. Herbal notes, let’s say. Lemon peels and slightly grassy notes too. Lots of fun! Mouth: really oily again, mixing green apple with peach, lychee and mango. Slightly artificial and candied, but at the same time very Irish and very likeable. White grapes and light honey. Then a hint of vanilla, grassy touches and even a mild earthy touch. Finish: long, with more artificial fruits like strawberries and pineapple. Still some green hints of aniseed. Quite a unique style of fruits here. I’m always surprised of how influenced we become by artifical fruit flavours. For instance it’s really hard to buy a truly ripe peach or mango these days, and in a way we become more accustomed to peach candy or mango yoghurt than to the actual fruits. If Plato had been a whisky drinker, I’m sure he would have a few things to say on this. We’re deviating: this is a lovely whiskey. A private bottling for Edward Zeng, if I’m not mistaken.",

         "Nose: quite a buttery and musty start. In all honesty, I didn’t do my research before starting this review and I didn’t expect the peat. It’s not very smoke either, at first it came accross as a dirty Highlands style. Later there is toffee sweetness, worn leather and a mix of minty notes with metallic hints. Then also burnt vanilla and more obvious smoke. Mouth: still a bit off. There’s a youthful alcoholic edge, a brown sugar sweetness and some peppery heat. Yellow apples and barbecue ashes. Sweaty notes. Light hints of fruit cake as well as a refreshing touch of mint and pine needle. Eyebrows are frowning. Finish: short to medium length, with herbal notes, very light chocolate and vegetal smoke. Except for the (slightly overdone) sweetness, this Bladnoch Alinta doesn’t show a classic PX influence (such a contrast to the lovely Bladnoch 14 Year Old). In fact it isn’t classic in any way. If you’re aiming for a harmonious composition, then a 4 year-old and a 12 year-old are possibly a bit too far apart? Especially the youth comes out.

Sharper horseradish and mustard. Light waxy notes (paraffin) and a lot of walnuts too. Pleasantly austere. Mouth: a sweet fruitiness appears first. Gooseberries, pears and peach, mixed with menthol, walnuts and herbal tea. Light seaweed and grassy / minty notes. I think the peat is brighter and more subdued than the nose suggested. Black peppercorns towards the end. Finish: long, peaty and rather waxy, with hints of citrus fruits, ink and ashes. Maybe not as classic as many Islay whiskies, but I’ve always had a thing for well-aged Connemara from this era. Back then they were getting a lot of attention and praise, and they were often selected as festival bottlings. Nowadays they have fallen a little into oblivion.

While the nose suggested a more candied, syrupy whiskey, this Rebreast turned more winey and herbal on the palate. It tends to overtake what I like so much about Redbreast.

Then sherry notes rise, like dried figs and raisins. It is a warm Lagavulin-like smokiness, rather than the more medicinal character of Laphroaig for instance. Hint of marzipan, black peppercorns and sweet dough underneath. Mouth: nicely intense, with a youngish raw note but also plenty of warmth. Salty notes are back, but so are the caramelized walnuts and fudge. Then a bit more medicinal and sooty elements, along with raisins, plenty of wood smoke, aniseed and hints of freshly sawn oak. Always this herbal element underneath, sweet and sharp at the same time. Finish: medium length, alternating between toffee sweetness and lemony freshness. Smouldering ashes in the very end. A really good daily dram with a nice depth and beautiful sooty side. The average age is probably not very high, but it does offer intensity, reasonable complexity and a nice balance.

The apple flavour now shifts towards apple peelings as well. Finish: medium. Pretty neutral, with apple and peppery warmth.

The Kirsch cask seems to offer just a little more juiciness and the TWE cask a bit more hints of grain whisky. Mouth: sweet again, now partly taken over by toffee and fudge notes, pushing the apple sweetness to the background. Then sweet oak, a hint of citrus and plenty of spicy notes. Finish: medium. Plenty of oak spice again. Similar cask, similar thoughts. Pairing this spirit to a Calvados cask is a nice idea, but the oak itself is a little intrusive.

         " coastal and mossy despite the fortified wine cask. a lot of kelp and sea salt, with savoury notes and cold ashes. then mild chocolate and smoked oranges, along with caramelized peanuts and hints of bread crust. after a while some green apple shines through as well.  sooty and herbal peat, in a rather chisseled way, with a certain lemony and aniseedy sharpness. then black peppercorns, caramelized nuts, herbal honey and hints of oranges. marmalade too, but never the deep sweetness we were expecting.  quite long, mostly on black pepper now, along with salted ashes. of course ardbeg sets expectations, and this bottling doesn’t fulfill them entirely. not bad at all, it just shows a little less depth and volume than we’d hoped. the sister cask #2006 can still be bought from the whisky exchange, by the way."

         " red candy, raspberry and redcurrants, as well as raisin cake, plum jam and hints of butterscotch. then some creamy vanilla, brown sugar and hints of thyme syrup in the background. there are some wood shavings and cinnamon as well, with light nutty notes.  the pot still spice comes out, with a light bitter edge. orange peels and nutmeg, with walnuts and some tannic notes, almost of a mulled wine or vermouth. more winey than i expected. black peppercorns, hints of burnt sugar, as well as some herbal notes and chocolate brownies towards the end.  medium length, with more chocolate and herbs, alongside liquorice and clove. while the nose suggested a more candied, syrupy whiskey, this rebreast turned more winey and herbal on the palate. it tends to overtake what i like so much about redbreast. decent but only a shadow of the glorious single port casks, and i prefer the px release as well. now sold out in most places except for the redbreast shop – although they mention a lower abv of only 40%."
