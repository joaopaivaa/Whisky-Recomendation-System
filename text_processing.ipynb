         "Nose: a lot of sherry influence, but never in-your-face. First tart gooseberries, yellow apples and oranges, along with bread dough and plain malt. A little damp chalk too. Then it becomes more buttery, with a hint of blonde tobacco. Some vegetal notes, lightly roasted coffee beans, a certain mustiness and leather. Mouth: still a bit of a mashup. The vegetal side is bigger, along with green fruits and persistent chalky notes. Apple peelings, pepper and nutmeg, as well as some roasted nuts. Quite robust, with some sweetness underneath, but the spiciness overtakes it quickly. Bittersweet woody notes towards the end, disrupting the balance further. Finish: quite long, with punchy oak spice, more bittersweet hints, nutmeg and chalk. Most of these secret Highlands are rumoured to come from Clynelish. Most of them seem to be outliers that don’t really fit the official profile. Here as well, there are some pleasant elements but it also misses some typical markers so the overall enjoyment is, well, merely okay. Still available from the Whiskydudes website.    ",

Then becoming more classic, on plums and raisins, leathery notes, orange peels and light hints of walnuts. Just a little toffee. All good. Mouth: slightly tart now, more oranges (fresh and candied), along with brown sugar and a little burnt toast. Mid-palate a nice fruity layer appears, think tangerine and roasted pineapple. Then some caramelized nuts and cinnamon. Finish: quite long, getting a tad winey now, with hints of dark cocoa, more raisins and a coastal touch of salinity. Ah yes, much more classic. Inchgower may not be a big name, but it’s a very flexible spirit. The Oloroso influence is well balanced too: success.",

Hints of black pepper and dried figs in the background, along with roasted nuts, walnuts and salted caramel. Finish: not too long, slightly leathery, with drying herbal notes but still some raisiny echoes as well. Now we’re talking, this session is evolving in crescendo. This is simply very balanced and true to its origins. I feel the sherry cask was nicely complementary too. Still available from a few partner retailers.",

Marinated charred meat, caramelized notes and tart plum. A really nice mix of sweet, sour and savoury. Spanish ham, a drop of espresso and toffee.

Some sweet elements, like raisins, but certainly not the PX influence we were expecting. Still a sourish winey note, and the smoky layer has a faint musty / sulphuric edge. Finish: fairly long. A bit thinner, nuttier and spicier. Earthy notes and raisins too. So, does this scream ‘high-quality cask’? Not really. Somehow the PX cask has more drying elements than the (technically dry) Palo Cortado. It all shows a lot of different containers are currently presented as sherry(-ish) casks.

Mouth: the toasted wood is getting firmer now, with the bitterness of coffee and herbal extracts. Drying tobacco leaves, more nutmeg and ginger, as well as light resinous notes. Sandalwood. Some dried fruits underneath, along with burnt caramel. Finish: quite long, still dark and rather wood-driven. Cigar boxes, heavily infused herbal tea and caramelized notes. This is 100% Folle Blanche. Quite a robust start, with a fair deal of wood coming through. Not necessarily my preferred style of armagnac, but the ABV helps to keep the balance.    ",

There’s also a funky hint of tepache and green grape skins, along with a subtle ashy hint. After settling down, it delivers flashes of yellow fruits and dried wildflowers. Totally unexpected. Mouth: more accessible, even though it’s still a rather sharp mix of grape juice with bags of salt, pine resin and peppermint. Still some vaguely farmy elements, along with grappa and grape seeds, sunflower oil and hints of grapefruit skins. Finish: medium, with hints of (unflavoured) tsipouro and mildly bitter herbs. This is 100% Baco. Independent bottlers usually don’t venture into this category of young spirits, so this is definitely a bold choice. A very peculiar profile. I had to try this on different occasions (as always with samples that don’t “click” right away) and I have to admit it grows on you.",

Then plenty of polished furniture, beeswax and nice hints of tobacco underneath. A few drops of old Oloroso. It also shows a rancio note and a clarity that brings it closer to cognac. Mouth: starts well, with this fruity core again. Figs and dates, with brighter berries and hints of bergamot and orange peels. A subtle floral note (rose petals) too. Mid-palate it turns towards herbal tea with a little ginger. There’s some tannins as well, along with clove oil and a woody edge. Finish: long, a combination of dried fruits, walnuts and some leathery hints. A lovely armagnac from the start to the finish. There’s a bit of tangy oak coming through, but perfectly in line with expectations for such an old armagnac. Pretty excellent and a great first selection.",

This moves towards resinous hints and some clove oil, which makes it a little thin and lightweight, lacking some of the darker notes.

A nice juicy acidity, paired to gingery notes and a punch of pepper. Now more towards blackberries and black cherries again. Some marmalade and cocoa in the end.

Mouth: candied fruits and stone fruits, with hints of pear and pineapple in the background. Then the metallic side comes back, along with ginger and pepper, up to the point where it becomes ever so slightly medicinal. Candied lemon peels, some toasted wood and hints of leathery dryness in the end. Finish: medium length, with dried fruits, drying liquorice roots and some honeyed notes.

Then pine needles and mentholated notes, as well as some nutmeg and allspice. Hints of baked apple and fig jam in the background, but they are struggling to get heard under the tannins and cigar boxes. The wood also brings a fragrant element. Finish: long, quite mentholated, with a profound earthy note but mostly a numbing combination of wood and alcohol. This was 100% Colombard, matured in a Gascony ‘black oak’ barrel. Quite the opposite of the 2001, richer and far more wood-driven. Even a little over-oaked, with the appearance of floral potpourri. Fairly cheap but a little over the top, in my opinion.",

Finish: medium to long, with a bit of alcohol heat along with orchard fruits, marmalade and hints of liquorice.

Quite woody, but in an aromatic way. There are some bright fruity hints to keep things in check. Some honey and citrus acidity as well.

         "Nose: very classy sherry. That means raisins, dried apricots, juicy sultanas and cherries. Oak polish. Then also honeyed notes, hints of pollen and toffee, light tobacco and brown sugar. Drops of high quality Oloroso as well. Hints of milk chocolate coated nuts and caramelized peanuts, along with subtle oak spice like cinnamon and ginger. This could have been a Family Cask release so far. Mouth: the alcohol comes out more, leaving a bit of a sherry brandy feeling. Still raisins and cherries, with boozy fruit cake and orange peels. Mild herbal notes and toasted walnuts, along with leathery notes. Then increasing cocoa, plum jam and a faint hint of sourish coffee. Finish: long and balanced. More sweet and sour fruits, nutty hints and chocolate. A rather excellent Glenfarclas, much like in the days of the first Family Casks. All about elegance, with a good dose of fruits, polished oak and refined herbs. Great selection work!    ",

Being a modern seasoned cask, there’s a good dose of active wood and vanilla too. Then darker hints of coffee beans, toffee and dark chocolate in the background. Just a balsamic / varnished touch as well. Mouth: very punchy. Again this mix of raisins, red berries, prunes, orange peels, dark chocolate and a leathery dryness. A lot of honey. Some herbal extracts as well, before it moves towards resinous notes, cinnamon, black pepper and candied ginger. Spices become quite loud towards the end, but the dram does take water well. Finish: long and spicy, with aniseed, cinnamon and a boozy (sherry brandy) edge. As good as it gets when it comes to modern sherry casks. A fairly big fruitiness, with a big bourbonny footprint as well. It’s actually a bourbon cask that was transferred to first-fill sherry after 8 years of maturation. A very solid example of Billy Walker’s style.",

Mouth: sooty and herbal peat, in a rather chisseled way, with a certain lemony and aniseedy sharpness. Then black peppercorns, caramelized nuts, herbal honey and hints of oranges. Marmalade too, but never the deep sweetness we were expecting. Finish: quite long, mostly on black pepper now, along with salted ashes.

There’s a darker hint of tea and oriental spice in the distance, but otherwise this is a fairly high-pitched profile. Such aromatic elegance after all these years! Mouth: a fruit explosion. Very juicy citrus notes, like lime and pink grapefruit, along with mango and drops of passion fruit syrup. Then orange peels and hints of Earl Grey , as well as growing spearmint and a light mentholated note. Hints of liquorice, some herbal tea and a subtle leafy note (tobacco) in the background, adding more depth. Towards the end a little leather and beautiful rancio too. Finish: long, with more orange peels now, generous minty notes and herbs, as well as some fruit jellies and a hint of cedar. Beautifully vibrant on the nose, which stays light and seductive. A bit more depth on the palate, with a nice power after all these years, but still plenty of fruits as well. No signs of tiredness at all. Truly excellent cognac which checks all the boxes for me.

Increasingly grainy and herbal towards the end, showing liquorice and a subtle bitter edge too. Finish: fairly short and malty, on nutmeg, salted caramel and a little cumin. Yeah well, not much of a discovery. It’s pretty flat and uninspired so there’s mostly a sentimental value.

Then also slightly tropical notes, like roasted pineapple and banana, in the background. Obviously also the typical markers of old metal tools, candle wax, herbal tea and burnt firwood. Mouth: more tobacco and herbs, as well as asubtle walnut bitterness. Then back to blackberries, sour cherries and raisins, some oriental spice and a hint of motor oil. Some black peppercorns and sandalwood, with glazed chestnuts and hints of liquorice. Some cocoa as well, although the whole gets thinner towards the end. Finish: long, with a lightly tannic edge (wine cask after all), peppery oak, earthy smoke and hints of salted caramel. This cracker reminded me of these sherry bottlings from Decadent Drinks.

Pineapple comes later. Then it moves towards citrus zest, paraffin and hints of nutmeg and green tea. A subtle saltiness in the background. Hints of dried flowers too. Finish: reasonably long given the low ABV. Back to chamomile and vegetal oils, along with some lime and leafy notes.

Not that this rum needs it. After comparing to the Oloroso, this appears to be sharper and cleaner, with a very light yeasty touch indeed. Overall fairly close to a naked Hampden. Mouth: boom. Very good, but heavy stuff. More brine, hints of vinegar and all kinds of synthetic materials. Then also a sour fruity note, a mix of lime juice and very unripe pineapple. Also a salty touch and some drying nutty notes towards the end (almonds). Finish: long and salty, on liquorice, peppermint, lemons and more esters. Nice rum, very pure. An extreme style, not very wide, and I sometimes find it hard work to drink this style.

The most balanced nose of all four in my opinion. Mouth: again truckloads of brine, acetone, glue and peppermint. I also detected a certain walnut dryness and over-infused tea. You really get that leathery / estery coating. Then one raisins perhaps, that must be the Oloroso. It seems this cask induced a bit more oak as well.

French oak perhaps, it displays a different kind of spiciness. Finish: very salty. Anchovies and acetone, with drops of red wine. This is the first one that doesn’t feel at ease with the cask.

Light tobacco and red berry notes. Then the usual ammonia, tarry notes and salty liquorice. In the end we’re getting that leathery dryness again, perhaps less sweet than expected after all. Finish: long but losing some of its richness now. In a series that focuses on cask types, I believe the cask should play first fiddle. This is the only version for which this is actually true, the others are still an ode to esters instead of wood.

         "Nose: PX, I would say. It’s full of treacle, dried figs and some mild meaty hints. Subtle hints of charred orange peels and wood shavings, especially cedarwood. Worn leather, brown bread and copper coins too. Slightly rugged but not exactly dirty. Mouth: active wood comes out now, with firm hints of cigar boxes and leather, along with raisins, figs and dates. Then back to orange peels, as well as some minty notes and sour berries. Mid-palate bitterness comes forward (herbal liqueur). There’s some Campbeltown funk as well, including a touch of flints and gunpowder. Finish: long, becoming leafier, on tobacco and salted caramel. Rumoured to be a teaspooned Glen Scotia. Quite characterful and not as dirty as I feared. Only the woody side is borderline for me.    ",

Pencil shavings and aromatic tea too, but the honey is always on top. Mouth: sweet and fruity, with more mango, peach and plenty of honey again. Orange juice and orange peels, tropical fruit jam and vanilla. Quite sweet and bourbonny, with plenty of active wood spice as well. Nutmeg, aniseed and ginger.

Then darker hints of ham and coffee, along with barbecue ashes and a bit of toffee sweetness. Finish: long and sooty, with a lot of seawater, smoked fish, black pepper and burnt plastics.

There’s a nice hint of furniture polish and almond cream as well. Then a little powder sugar and fresh mint leaves. Mouth: a fruity core with melons, (slightly greener) bananas, mirabelles and a hint of passion fruit. The creamy and honeyed side is clear, along with vanilla and a hint of caramel. Mid-palate some oak spice appears, like ginger and pepper. The fruits gets a little more zesty towards the end, with a subtle grassy touch.

Then there’s also a mild hint of potpourri and marihuana. Herbal notes, let’s say. Lemon peels and slightly grassy notes too. Lots of fun! Mouth: really oily again, mixing green apple with peach, lychee and mango. Slightly artificial and candied, but at the same time very Irish and very likeable. White grapes and light honey. Then a hint of vanilla, grassy touches and even a mild earthy touch. Finish: long, with more artificial fruits like strawberries and pineapple. Still some green hints of aniseed. Quite a unique style of fruits here. I’m always surprised of how influenced we become by artifical fruit flavours. For instance it’s really hard to buy a truly ripe peach or mango these days, and in a way we become more accustomed to peach candy or mango yoghurt than to the actual fruits. If Plato had been a whisky drinker, I’m sure he would have a few things to say on this. We’re deviating: this is a lovely whiskey. A private bottling for Edward Zeng, if I’m not mistaken.",

Herbal notes become stronger now, mostly sage and mint, along with some cardamom. Then a clear floral layer as well.

         "Nose: quite a buttery and musty start. In all honesty, I didn’t do my research before starting this review and I didn’t expect the peat. It’s not very smoke either, at first it came accross as a dirty Highlands style. Later there is toffee sweetness, worn leather and a mix of minty notes with metallic hints. Then also burnt vanilla and more obvious smoke. Mouth: still a bit off. There’s a youthful alcoholic edge, a brown sugar sweetness and some peppery heat. Yellow apples and barbecue ashes. Sweaty notes. Light hints of fruit cake as well as a refreshing touch of mint and pine needle. Eyebrows are frowning. Finish: short to medium length, with herbal notes, very light chocolate and vegetal smoke. Except for the (slightly overdone) sweetness, this Bladnoch Alinta doesn’t show a classic PX influence (such a contrast to the lovely Bladnoch 14 Year Old). In fact it isn’t classic in any way. If you’re aiming for a harmonious composition, then a 4 year-old and a 12 year-old are possibly a bit too far apart? Especially the youth comes out.

Sharper horseradish and mustard. Light waxy notes (paraffin) and a lot of walnuts too. Pleasantly austere. Mouth: a sweet fruitiness appears first. Gooseberries, pears and peach, mixed with menthol, walnuts and herbal tea. Light seaweed and grassy / minty notes. I think the peat is brighter and more subdued than the nose suggested. Black peppercorns towards the end. Finish: long, peaty and rather waxy, with hints of citrus fruits, ink and ashes. Maybe not as classic as many Islay whiskies, but I’ve always had a thing for well-aged Connemara from this era. Back then they were getting a lot of attention and praise, and they were often selected as festival bottlings. Nowadays they have fallen a little into oblivion.

Black peppercorns, hints of burnt sugar, as well as some herbal notes and chocolate brownies towards the end. Finish: medium length, with more chocolate and herbs, alongside liquorice and clove. While the nose suggested a more candied, syrupy whiskey, this Rebreast turned more winey and herbal on the palate. It tends to overtake what I like so much about Redbreast. Decent but only a shadow of the glorious single Port casks, and I prefer the PX release as well.

Then sherry notes rise, like dried figs and raisins. It is a warm Lagavulin-like smokiness, rather than the more medicinal character of Laphroaig for instance. Hint of marzipan, black peppercorns and sweet dough underneath. Mouth: nicely intense, with a youngish raw note but also plenty of warmth. Salty notes are back, but so are the caramelized walnuts and fudge. Then a bit more medicinal and sooty elements, along with raisins, plenty of wood smoke, aniseed and hints of freshly sawn oak. Always this herbal element underneath, sweet and sharp at the same time. Finish: medium length, alternating between toffee sweetness and lemony freshness. Smouldering ashes in the very end. A really good daily dram with a nice depth and beautiful sooty side. The average age is probably not very high, but it does offer intensity, reasonable complexity and a nice balance. While it seems to be sold out in the UK, there are bottles available from German stores and other European countries.    ",

Finish: medium, mostly on oak spice, a hint of leathery dryness and oranges. Another good mix of peat and sherry, in a slightly lighter / colder style. Great balance, although Beach Bonfire had more depth to it.

Then some drying grainy notes quickly set in, moving towards greenish oak spice like pepper, clove and ginger. A mildly tannic / fizzy edge. The apple flavour now shifts towards apple peelings as well. Finish: medium. Pretty neutral, with apple and peppery warmth.

The Kirsch cask seems to offer just a little more juiciness and the TWE cask a bit more hints of grain whisky. Mouth: sweet again, now partly taken over by toffee and fudge notes, pushing the apple sweetness to the background. Then sweet oak, a hint of citrus and plenty of spicy notes. Finish: medium. Plenty of oak spice again. Similar cask, similar thoughts. Pairing this spirit to a Calvados cask is a nice idea, but the oak itself is a little intrusive.

After that it becomes decidedly more industrial, with metallic notes and beautiful greasy touches and citronella wax, hints of cold ashes and mineral salts. Mouth: quite mild, which is not surprising given the ABV. Again these sweet green fruits, a mix of grapes, kiwi, gooseberry and maybe underripe mango. Then more towards lemon peels and grapefruit, along with more waxy notes, herbal tea and white pepper. Finish: not too long, quite mineral with a subtle salty note and green fruits in the background.

         "Nose: a lot of sherry influence, but never in-your-face. First tart gooseberries, yellow apples and oranges, along with bread dough and plain malt. A little damp chalk too. Then it becomes more buttery, with a hint of blonde tobacco. Some vegetal notes, lightly roasted coffee beans, a certain mustiness and leather. Mouth: still a bit of a mashup. The vegetal side is bigger, along with green fruits and persistent chalky notes. Apple peelings, pepper and nutmeg, as well as some roasted nuts. Quite robust, with some sweetness underneath, but the spiciness overtakes it quickly. Bittersweet woody notes towards the end, disrupting the balance further. Finish: quite long, with punchy oak spice, more bittersweet hints, nutmeg and chalk. Most of these secret Highlands are rumoured to come from Clynelish. Most of them seem to be outliers that don’t really fit the official profile. Here as well, there are some pleasant elements but it also misses some typical markers so the overall enjoyment is, well, merely okay. Still available from the Whiskydudes website.    ",

         "Nose: lots of butter biscuits at first, even a hint of evaporated milk, but not for long. Then becoming more classic, on plums and raisins, leathery notes, orange peels and light hints of walnuts. Just a little toffee. All good. Mouth: slightly tart now, more oranges (fresh and candied), along with brown sugar and a little burnt toast. Mid-palate a nice fruity layer appears, think tangerine and roasted pineapple. Then some caramelized nuts and cinnamon. Finish: quite long, getting a tad winey now, with hints of dark cocoa, more raisins and a coastal touch of salinity. Ah yes, much more classic. Inchgower may not be a big name, but it’s a very flexible spirit. The Oloroso influence is well balanced too: success.",

A very pleasant dusty side as well. Less funky than, say, Springbank, but plenty of character. Mouth: oily, with a herbal theme, some aniseed and lightly caramelized notes. Hints of black pepper and dried figs in the background, along with roasted nuts, walnuts and salted caramel. Finish: not too long, slightly leathery, with drying herbal notes but still some raisiny echoes as well. Now we’re talking, this session is evolving in crescendo. This is simply very balanced and true to its origins. I feel the sherry cask was nicely complementary too. Still available from a few partner retailers.",

Marinated charred meat, caramelized notes and tart plum. A really nice mix of sweet, sour and savoury. Spanish ham, a drop of espresso and toffee. Finish: long, sweet and smoky, with flashes of red fruit and charcoal. Another good one, with a deep Islay character and a cask match that works really well.",

Of course ashes, sea salt and some rusty notes as well. Mouth: big smoky notes, with plenty of coffee, black pepper and bonfire ashes. A lot of charcoal, a good dose of plain wood too. Some sweet elements, like raisins, but certainly not the PX influence we were expecting. Still a sourish winey note, and the smoky layer has a faint musty / sulphuric edge. Finish: fairly long. A bit thinner, nuttier and spicier. Earthy notes and raisins too. So, does this scream ‘high-quality cask’? Not really. Somehow the PX cask has more drying elements than the (technically dry) Palo Cortado. It all shows a lot of different containers are currently presented as sherry(-ish) casks. And that it must be difficult for bottlers to know which ones are actually worth using.",

Then dark honey and caramel notes, along with some vanilla pastry and hints of baking spice, especially nutmeg. Mouth: the toasted wood is getting firmer now, with the bitterness of coffee and herbal extracts. Drying tobacco leaves, more nutmeg and ginger, as well as light resinous notes. Sandalwood. Some dried fruits underneath, along with burnt caramel. Finish: quite long, still dark and rather wood-driven. Cigar boxes, heavily infused herbal tea and caramelized notes. This is 100% Folle Blanche. Quite a robust start, with a fair deal of wood coming through. Not necessarily my preferred style of armagnac, but the ABV helps to keep the balance.    ",

There’s also a funky hint of tepache and green grape skins, along with a subtle ashy hint. After settling down, it delivers flashes of yellow fruits and dried wildflowers. Totally unexpected. Mouth: more accessible, even though it’s still a rather sharp mix of grape juice with bags of salt, pine resin and peppermint. Still some vaguely farmy elements, along with grappa and grape seeds, sunflower oil and hints of grapefruit skins. Finish: medium, with hints of (unflavoured) tsipouro and mildly bitter herbs. This is 100% Baco. Independent bottlers usually don’t venture into this category of young spirits, so this is definitely a bold choice. A very peculiar profile. I had to try this on different occasions (as always with samples that don’t “click” right away) and I have to admit it grows on you.",

Then plenty of polished furniture, beeswax and nice hints of tobacco underneath. A few drops of old Oloroso. It also shows a rancio note and a clarity that brings it closer to cognac. Mouth: starts well, with this fruity core again. Figs and dates, with brighter berries and hints of bergamot and orange peels. A subtle floral note (rose petals) too. Mid-palate it turns towards herbal tea with a little ginger. There’s some tannins as well, along with clove oil and a woody edge. Finish: long, a combination of dried fruits, walnuts and some leathery hints. A lovely armagnac from the start to the finish. There’s a bit of tangy oak coming through, but perfectly in line with expectations for such an old armagnac. Pretty excellent and a great first selection.",

Also a bit of that typical metallic undertone, as well as a grainy touch. Even some sugary rum notes at times. Mouth: candied fruits and stone fruits, with hints of pear and pineapple in the background. Then the metallic side comes back, along with ginger and pepper, up to the point where it becomes ever so slightly medicinal. Candied lemon peels, some toasted wood and hints of leathery dryness in the end. Finish: medium length, with dried fruits, drying liquorice roots and some honeyed notes. This is more of a yellow fruit style, with more youth, less complexity and a peculiar mineral / metallic note that is a little out of place.

Then pine needles and mentholated notes, as well as some nutmeg and allspice. Hints of baked apple and fig jam in the background, but they are struggling to get heard under the tannins and cigar boxes. The wood also brings a fragrant element. Finish: long, quite mentholated, with a profound earthy note but mostly a numbing combination of wood and alcohol. This was 100% Colombard, matured in a Gascony ‘black oak’ barrel. Quite the opposite of the 2001, richer and far more wood-driven. Even a little over-oaked, with the appearance of floral potpourri. Fairly cheap but a little over the top, in my opinion.",

Quite woody, but in an aromatic way. There are some bright fruity hints to keep things in check. Some honey and citrus acidity as well.

Mild herbal notes and toasted walnuts, along with leathery notes. Then increasing cocoa, plum jam and a faint hint of sourish coffee. Finish: long and balanced.

Some herbal extracts as well, before it moves towards resinous notes, cinnamon, black pepper and candied ginger. Spices become quite loud towards the end, but the dram does take water well. Finish: long and spicy, with aniseed, cinnamon and a boozy (sherry brandy) edge. As good as it gets when it comes to modern sherry casks.

Very juicy citrus notes, like lime and pink grapefruit, along with mango and drops of passion fruit syrup. Then orange peels and hints of Earl Grey , as well as growing spearmint and a light mentholated note.

Some black peppercorns and sandalwood, with glazed chestnuts and hints of liquorice. Some cocoa as well, although the whole gets thinner towards the end. Finish: long, with a lightly tannic edge (wine cask after all), peppery oak, earthy smoke and hints of salted caramel. This cracker reminded me of these sherry bottlings from Decadent Drinks.

         "Nose: slightly middle-of-the-road, in the sense that nothing stands out. Some toffee and heather honey, some oranges and apples, some raisins. Then also coastal notes and mild oak spice, with a faint floral edge. Moist wood too. In the end the caramelized layer stands out most. Mouth: more characterful now, even though it’s quite hot. Now the charred notes and peat smoke are a bit more noticeable, as well as generous vegetal notes. Leafy notes, some peppers and a subte hint of drying tobacco. Then sweet caramel again, with a hint of latte, drying nuts and mild herbal tea. Nutmeg too. Finish: long, still showing this drying leafy note, wood spice, liquorice and more tobacco. Rather unsophisticated when taken neat, with obvious heat. Also hindered by caramel notes, and overall a rough and ready expression. In fact water makes it better, which makes it a contradictory release. You can get a newer batch from Master of Malt or Royal Mile Whiskies for instance.",

         "Nose: a truly beautiful, oily fruitiness. Candied pineapple, along with apricot jam, juicy mirabelles, tangerines and vanilla cake. There’s a gentle waxy side, as well as some subtle leathery touches. Then orange peels, very light oregano, subtle sea spray and hints of women’s powder. Pretty excellent. Mouth: a bit soft, but showing more fruitiness. Stewed orchard fruits, like apricots, apples, papaya and pineapple. Honey and candied peels. Then it moves towards almonds, with cinnamon and light mocha. Subtle saltiness, liquorice and hints of mint leaves. Beautifully polished oak and whiffs of dried flower petals as well. Really great. Finish: long enough, with more citrus peels, subtle cocoa, drops of coffee and mildly drying oak spice. Definitely a rare find. Aromatic, great balance, a nice amount of fruitiness coupled to some maritime notes. A cracking Bunnahabhain and even the price is reasonable. Still available from The Whisky Exchange.

Barbecue smoke, a green olive and a faint meaty edge in the distance. Finish: long and perfectly sharp, with coastal notes, peppery smoke and light herbal elements.

Some sweet and sour cherries and some plankish wood, along with ginger, toffee and dark chocolate. Finish: long, slightly leafy, with lingering caramel sweetness and warming oak spice.

Not that this rum needs it. After comparing to the Oloroso, this appears to be sharper and cleaner, with a very light yeasty touch indeed. Overall fairly close to a naked Hampden. Mouth: boom. Very good, but heavy stuff. More brine, hints of vinegar and all kinds of synthetic materials. Then also a sour fruity note, a mix of lime juice and very unripe pineapple. Also a salty touch and some drying nutty notes towards the end (almonds). Finish: long and salty, on liquorice, peppermint, lemons and more esters. Nice rum, very pure. An extreme style, not very wide, and I sometimes find it hard work to drink this style. More importantly, I believe the point of this series is to showcase the difference of cask types, and in that sense I would have let it mature a little longer. A success nonetheless.    ",

The most balanced nose of all four in my opinion. Mouth: again truckloads of brine, acetone, glue and peppermint. I also detected a certain walnut dryness and over-infused tea. You really get that leathery / estery coating. Then one raisins perhaps, that must be the Oloroso. It seems this cask induced a bit more oak as well. Finish: long and totally briney, with just a hint of berry juice and more nutty dryness. The spirit itself is still having the upper hand, even though the difference with the Fino cask is easy to notice. More complexity as well.",

Mouth: reminiscent of a musty Port influence now, but also red wine again. Quite dry, with red fruits as well as a leathery, slightly tannic edge. French oak perhaps, it displays a different kind of spiciness. Finish: very salty. Anchovies and acetone, with drops of red wine. This is the first one that doesn’t feel at ease with the cask.

More spicy notes here (cardamom, pepper), even a very light hint of cocoa in the distance. Good. Mouth: richer and sweeter than the others. Caramelized walnuts, a bit of roasted sugar and tobacco. Light tobacco and red berry notes. Then the usual ammonia, tarry notes and salty liquorice. In the end we’re getting that leathery dryness again, perhaps less sweet than expected after all. Finish: long but losing some of its richness now. In a series that focuses on cask types, I believe the cask should play first fiddle. This is the only version for which this is actually true, the others are still an ode to esters instead of wood. The Oloroso wins on overall balance (by a small margin) but this is really nice as well.",

Mouth: active wood comes out now, with firm hints of cigar boxes and leather, along with raisins, figs and dates. Then back to orange peels, as well as some minty notes and sour berries. Mid-palate bitterness comes forward (herbal liqueur). There’s some Campbeltown funk as well, including a touch of flints and gunpowder. Finish: long, becoming leafier, on tobacco and salted caramel.

Then a hint of vanilla, grassy touches and even a mild earthy touch. Finish: long, with more artificial fruits like strawberries and pineapple. Still some green hints of aniseed. Quite a unique style of fruits here. I’m always surprised of how influenced we become by artifical fruit flavours. For instance it’s really hard to buy a truly ripe peach or mango these days, and in a way we become more accustomed to peach candy or mango yoghurt than to the actual fruits.

         "Nose: quite a buttery and musty start. In all honesty, I didn’t do my research before starting this review and I didn’t expect the peat. It’s not very smoke either, at first it came accross as a dirty Highlands style. Later there is toffee sweetness, worn leather and a mix of minty notes with metallic hints. Then also burnt vanilla and more obvious smoke. Mouth: still a bit off. There’s a youthful alcoholic edge, a brown sugar sweetness and some peppery heat. Yellow apples and barbecue ashes. Sweaty notes. Light hints of fruit cake as well as a refreshing touch of mint and pine needle. Eyebrows are frowning. Finish: short to medium length, with herbal notes, very light chocolate and vegetal smoke. Except for the (slightly overdone) sweetness, this Bladnoch Alinta doesn’t show a classic PX influence (such a contrast to the lovely Bladnoch 14 Year Old). In fact it isn’t classic in any way. If you’re aiming for a harmonious composition, then a 4 year-old and a 12 year-old are possibly a bit too far apart? Especially the youth comes out.

Sharper horseradish and mustard. Light waxy notes (paraffin) and a lot of walnuts too. Pleasantly austere. Mouth: a sweet fruitiness appears first. Gooseberries, pears and peach, mixed with menthol, walnuts and herbal tea. Light seaweed and grassy / minty notes. I think the peat is brighter and more subdued than the nose suggested. Black peppercorns towards the end. Finish: long, peaty and rather waxy, with hints of citrus fruits, ink and ashes. Maybe not as classic as many Islay whiskies, but I’ve always had a thing for well-aged Connemara from this era. Back then they were getting a lot of attention and praise, and they were often selected as festival bottlings. Nowadays they have fallen a little into oblivion.

While the nose suggested a more candied, syrupy whiskey, this Rebreast turned more winey and herbal on the palate. It tends to overtake what I like so much about Redbreast.

Then sherry notes rise, like dried figs and raisins. It is a warm Lagavulin-like smokiness, rather than the more medicinal character of Laphroaig for instance. Hint of marzipan, black peppercorns and sweet dough underneath. Mouth: nicely intense, with a youngish raw note but also plenty of warmth. Salty notes are back, but so are the caramelized walnuts and fudge. Then a bit more medicinal and sooty elements, along with raisins, plenty of wood smoke, aniseed and hints of freshly sawn oak. Always this herbal element underneath, sweet and sharp at the same time. Finish: medium length, alternating between toffee sweetness and lemony freshness. Smouldering ashes in the very end. A really good daily dram with a nice depth and beautiful sooty side. The average age is probably not very high, but it does offer intensity, reasonable complexity and a nice balance. While it seems to be sold out in the UK, there are bottles available from German stores and other European countries.    ",

         "Nose: slightly more narrow, with a bit more alcohol heat. Higher-pitched notes of orange peels, later also darker hints of cocoa and strawberry jam. Then herbal notes, but fresher and less charred than Beach Bonfire, along with light leather. Slightly more coastal, with clean smoke. Hints of raspberry in the distance. Mouth: a cleaner and oilier profile again, with more charred orange peels, smoked lemons, iodine and balanced peat. It feels younger and rougher, showing less warmth than Beachfire Smoke, and less sweetness too. Some berry fruits, rather elegant sherry and some peppery prickle. Finish: medium, mostly on oak spice, a hint of leathery dryness and oranges. Another good mix of peat and sherry, in a slightly lighter / colder style. Great balance, although Beach Bonfire had more depth to it. I believe this was released for Feis Ile 2024 and it’s still available here and there (albeit with a slightly different ABV and no bottle numbering).",

         "Nose: pleasant, full of stewed apples or Kaiserschmarrn with whipped cream on the side. There’s a nuttiness to it, as well as some buttery caramel notes that make it a little bulky. Then a little lime, some cinnamon and a general spicy / grassy undertone. Mouth: sweet and spicy. Still a good dose of apple pastry and apple sauce, with vanilla and subtle honey. Then some drying grainy notes quickly set in, moving towards greenish oak spice like pepper, clove and ginger. A mildly tannic / fizzy edge. The apple flavour now shifts towards apple peelings as well. Finish: medium. Pretty neutral, with apple and peppery warmth. The Calvados influence presumably highlights the innate fruitiness of the spirit, which is nice. On the other hand the spiciness is borderline. The choice for cask strength often narrows down young whisky, in my opinion.    ",

         "Nose: very, very similar, which isn’t surprising given the almost identical specs. Lots of apple aromas, in a sweet way. This is countered by a bready theme and oak spice. The Kirsch cask seems to offer just a little more juiciness and the TWE cask a bit more hints of grain whisky. Mouth: sweet again, now partly taken over by toffee and fudge notes, pushing the apple sweetness to the background. Then sweet oak, a hint of citrus and plenty of spicy notes. Finish: medium. Plenty of oak spice again. Similar cask, similar thoughts. Pairing this spirit to a Calvados cask is a nice idea, but the oak itself is a little intrusive. Exclusively available from The Whisky Exchange.",

Here as well the spicy side is prominent, with clove oil and hints of cardamom. Mouth: fairly creamy, with more red berries and blackcurrant. Now the grape-y and slightly meaty character of the red wine is also present. This leads to dark chocolate, black peppercorns, ginger and more nutty dryness. Finish: medium to long, with a brown sweetness, black pepper and hints of oak. While red wine finishes often struggle to convince me, this isn’t bad. It’s more entertaining than the Calvados casks and the amarone finds a decent balance. Available in German stores.",

         "Nose: quite gentle, with subdued medicinal notes. Instead we get more grape sweetness and lime, a little wax evolving to bacon fat, and rosemary oil, along with warm ashes. Subtle ocean spray. Some citrus peels (maybe bergamot) and thyme. This herbal edge mixes with Parma violets after a while, which I find a bit disturbing, but it fades. Just a whiff of beach bonfire in the distance. Mouth: mild, with velvety smoke, candied orange peels, sharp herbs and warm ashes. A burst of salinity. Then some fruits as well, slightly tropical but far less impactful than I hoped. Light mango and pink grapefruit. White pepper and generally a bit more punchy oak than the nose suggested. Light hints of walnuts and tobacco. Finish: medium length, now a bit more medicinal. Also lemon oil and ashes. A drying hint of rubber too. Quite a subtle, even slightly thin expression. Some ups and downs. I don’t think I’ve ever had earlier versions of Laphroaig 30 Year Old, but based on the old 25 Year Old and the 30-somethings from indie bottlers I was hoping for more fruity sparkle.

         "Nose: a quick fruity flash comes out first, in a youngish and green way, almost lemonade but also lime candy or even white grapes. Uncommon for Springbank of this age, but nice. After that it becomes decidedly more industrial, with metallic notes and beautiful greasy touches and citronella wax, hints of cold ashes and mineral salts. Mouth: quite mild, which is not surprising given the ABV. Again these sweet green fruits, a mix of grapes, kiwi, gooseberry and maybe underripe mango. Then more towards lemon peels and grapefruit, along with more waxy notes, herbal tea and white pepper. Finish: not too long, quite mineral with a subtle salty note and green fruits in the background. The greener side, the waxy notes and the softness makes it a rather different Springbank and moves it closer to Clynelish in a way. A nice variation on the Campbeltown theme. Still available from Decadent Drinks or partners like The Whisky Exchange for instance.    ",
